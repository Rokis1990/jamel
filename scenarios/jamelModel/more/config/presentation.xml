		<b>Abstract:</b>
		This paper proposes to model market mechanisms as a collective
		learning process for firms in a complex adaptive system, namely
		<i>Jamel,</i>
		an agent-based, stock-flow consistent macroeconomic model. Inspired by
		Alchian's (1950) "blanketing shotgun process" idea, our learning model
		is an ever-adapting process that puts a significant weight on
		exploration
		<i>vis-Ã -vis</i>
		exploitation. We show that decentralized market selection allows firms
		to collectively adapt their overall debt strategies to the changes in
		the macroeconomic environment so that the system sustains itself, but
		at the cost of recurrent deep downturns. We conclude that, in complex
		evolving economies, market processes do not lead to the selection of
		optimal behaviors, as the characterization of successful behaviors
		itself constantly evolves as a result of the market conditions that
		these behaviors contribute to shape. Heterogeneity in behavior remains
		essential to adaptation in such an ever-changing environment. We come
		to an evolutionary characterization of a crisis, as the point where
		the evolution of the macroeconomic system becomes faster than the
		adaptation capabilities of the agents that populate it, and the so far
		selected performing behaviors suddenly cease to be, and become instead
		undesirable.
